# 👋 Hi, I’m Álvaro Magalló Paz

In my professional life, I’m always driven by the following question:

> *How can we model the mind, with all its emergent logic, memory, and constraints, using the rigor of hardware, mathematics, and systems design?*

## 🧠 What defines my work

Since my teenage years, I’ve seen the mind not as something separate from matter, but as a formal, modelable structure emerging from it. That vision took shape during my Computer Engineering studies, where I developed a strong interest in the intersection between Computer Science and Psychology, ultimately focusing on **hardware-level emulation and verification** of cognitive architectures.

My projects aim to bridge **symbolic rigor with neural realism**, not just by mimicking the brain, but by developing interpretable architectures that respect cognitive dynamics. My work emphasizes **traceability, formal verification, symbolic modeling**, and **biologically inspired system behavior**.

## 🔍 What I build

### 🧪 Neuromorphic Hardware Development  
- **Circuit simulation** of circuits in VHDL-AMS representing simplified neuronal dynamics  
- **Symbolic translation** of analog behavior into SMT constraints using Z3  
- **Full traceability** graph (Requirements → Properties → Implementation → Verification)  
- **Compliance** with DO-254 and DO-333 standards (critical systems engineering)

> *“The final traceability model came to me while gazing out the window — I realized the project wasn’t just about circuits, but about epistemology: how we know that what we’ve built works as we intended.”*

### 🧠 Human Connectome Analysis 
- Analyzed **effective connectivity** using Rolls & Deco’s resting-state algorithm  
- Processed HCP S1200 data and parcellated brain maps using the extended HCPex atlas (180×2 ROIs)  
- Extracted both **resting-state** and **task-related** networks  
- Axial **visualization** of connectomes, aligned with dynamic fluctuations in functional connectivity

> *“Connectome modeling taught me how even chaotic systems leave mathematical fingerprints — and that those fingerprints tell stories.”*

### 🧱 Tiny Compiler Design
- Designed a **full compiler** toolchain for **Tiny**, a procedural programming language  
- **AST implementation** in Java 17 using record types, memoized reflection dispatch  
- Custom **p-code virtual machine** with typed instructions, stack frames, memory manager  
- **Structured types** (arrays, records, pointers), by-reference / by-value handling, exception control  
- VM memory modeled on **two-level RAM** structures with FAT-style **dynamic heap**

> *“Designing a language from scratch was an act of storytelling — every type system, every control structure, every stack overflow handler was a choice about how logic should flow.”*

### 🔢 Purely Functional Hashing

- **Interactive console application** in Haskell implementing a hash table based on Mersenne primes
- Built custom **big integer API** with boolean lists and using Karatsuba multiplication
- Implemented optimized **Lucas-Lehmer test** for prime verification
- Integrated advanced **remainder algorithms** specific for Mersenne-like numbers
- Used **balanced trees** as array substitutes to achieve logarithmic-time access


> *“This project brought me close to the edge where theory meets implementation — making number theory executable, and purity performant.”*

### ⛏ Mining Game Programming

- **Console-based mining game** in C++ for Windows, rendered entirely in **ANSI-colored** ASCII
- **Rebuilt UI** with escape sequences for a dynamic retro feel
- Designed **full player-facing interface** with authentication, score tracking, and session persistence
- **Gameplay** featured gem collection, obstacles, gravity-based physics, TNT clearing, and strategic scoring
- **Switchable board sizes** enabled different cognitive perspectives for level solving

> *“Combining low-level logic with visual storytelling taught me how design principles can emerge even in text-mode graphics.”*

## 🛠 Technical Stack

I don't see technologies as labels, I see them as **ways to shape systems**:

- **Formal Methods**: Z3, SMT, logical modeling, invariants, assertions  
- **Hardware Design**: VHDL-AMS, Siemens PartQuest, MBSE, DO-254/DO-333  
- **Languages**: Python, Java, Haskell, Elixir, C++, DSL design  
- **Mathematics**: symbolic systems, algebra, graph theory, category theory  
- **Modeling**: connectomics, artificial neural systems, verification pipelines

## 🌍 What I believe

> *“Technology should be rigorous, but human.  
Not just correct, but interpretable.  
Not just fast, but meaningful.”*

I believe in designing systems that **mirror our cognitive structure without losing formal control**.  
That means bringing together aerospace-level discipline, philosophical questions, and human-centered design.

If you’re working at the intersection of formal methods, cognitive architecture, or safety-critical systems, I’d love to connect.

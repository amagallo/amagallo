# 👋 Hi, I’m Álvaro Magalló Paz

## 🌱 Background  
Since I was 12, psychology has fascinated me as a way to understand the invisible: what we feel, think, and remember. During my Computer Engineering studies, I discovered **Computational Psychology**, where rigorous computer science meets the study of the mind. This vocation has led me to explore biologically inspired models such as Hopfield networks, Kohonen maps, and connectomics.  

## 🛠 Skills  
- **Formal Verification & Hardware Design**: DO-254/DO-333 flows, requirements traceability, VHDL-AMS simulation, Z3 SMT solving, and MBSE.  
- **Programming**: Python, Java, C++, Haskell.  
- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra, logic, symbolic reasoning, and category theory.  
- **Computational Modeling**: Biologically inspired networks and cognitive architectures.  

## 🚀 Experience  
- **Bachelor’s Thesis**: Formal verification of neuromorphic hardware with VHDL-AMS simulation, Z3 SMT solving, and Python APIs for DO-254 traceability.  
- **Compiler Project**: Designed a compiler for a procedural language (Tiny) with AST construction, reflection-based recursive processing, and a custom VM.  
- **Game Development**: Built console-based games in C++ with ANSI escape sequences and Windows API, focusing on performance and interactive graphics.  
- **Functional Data Structures**: Implemented a purely functional hash table in Haskell using Mersenne primes, based on academic research.  

## 🤝 Values  
I believe science must be tied to people. Building bridges between minds also means standing with those whose voices are hardest to hear. My vision is to create systems that combine **rigor, humanity, and responsibility**.

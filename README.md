# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm √Ålvaro

## üå± Background
Since I was 12, psychology has fascinated me as a way to understand the invisible: what we feel, think, and remember. During my Computer Engineering studies, I discovered **Computational Psychology**, where rigorous computer science meets the study of the mind. Reading *The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology*, edited by Ron Sun, and Margaret Boden‚Äôs work gave me clear direction and deep personal validation.

Since then, my vocation has centered on understanding how information flows in the brain and how we can draw parallels with artificial architecture. This vocation has led me to explore biologically inspired models such as Hopfield networks, Kohonen maps, and connectomics.

## üõ† Skills
- **Hardware Design & Verification:** DO-254/DO-333 development cycle, requirements traceability, Z3 SMT formal methodology, Siemens PartQuest simulation, and Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE).
- **Programming:** Python, VHDL-AMS, Java, C++, Haskell, Elixir.
- **Mathematics:** Number theory, linear algebra, logic, symbolic modeling, and category theory.
- **Computational Modeling:** Biologically inspired neural networks, human connectome analysis, and brain-inspired computational architectures.

## üöÄ Experience
- **Bachelor‚Äôs Thesis:**: Verification of neuromorphic hardware with Siemens PartQuest simulation, Z3 SMT formal methodology, and Python APIs for symbolic modeling of VHDL-AMS, to comply with DO-254 bidirectional traceability.
- **Compiler Development:** Designed a compiler for a procedural language with AST construction, reflection-based recursive processing, and a custom virtual machine.
- **Game Development:** Built console-based games in C++ with ANSI escape sequences and Windows API, focusing on performance and interactive graphics.
- **Functional Data Structures:** Implemented a purely functional hash table in Haskell using Mersenne primes, based on academic research.

## ü§ù Values
My commitment to science is inseparable from my commitment to people. From my point of view, building bridges between minds also means standing with those whose voices are hardest to hear. This conviction grounds my professional vision: creating systems that don‚Äôt just work, but that reflect **rigor, humanity, and responsibility**.

# 👋 Hi, I’m Álvaro Magalló Paz

As someone passionate for Computational Psychology, I’m driven the following question:

> *How can we model the mind, with all its emergent logic, memory, and constraints, using the rigor of hardware, mathematics, and systems design?*


## 🧠 What defines my work

Since my teenage years, I’ve seen psychology not as speculation, but as a formal, modelable structure. That vision found its path during my Computer Engineering studies, where I discovered **Computational Psychology**, and eventually focused on **hardware-level emulation and verification** of cognitive architectures.

My projects seek to bridge **symbolic rigor and neural realism** — not by mimicking the brain, but by developing interpretable architectures that respect the mind’s dynamics. I focus on traceability, formal verification, symbolic modeling, and biologically-inspired system behavior.

## 🔍 What I build

### 🧪 Neuromorphic Hardware Verification  
- Simulated VHDL-AMS circuits representing simplified neuronal dynamics  
- Symbolic translation of analog behavior into SMT constraints using Z3  
- Full traceability graph (Requirements → Properties → Implementation → Verification)  
- Compliance with DO-254 and DO-333 standards (critical systems engineering)

> *“The final traceability model came to me while gazing out the window — I realized the project wasn’t just about circuits, but about epistemology: how we know that what we’ve built works as we intended.”*

---

### 🧠 Connectomics Modeling  
- Analyzed effective connectomes using Rolls & Deco’s resting-state algorithm  
- Parsed HCP S1200 data; parcellated brain maps using the extended HCPex atlas (180×2 ROIs)  
- Extracted both resting-state and gambling task networks  
- Axial visualization of connectomes, aligned with dynamic fluctuations in functional connectivity

> *“Connectome modeling taught me how even chaotic systems leave mathematical fingerprints — and that those fingerprints tell stories.”*

---

### 🧱 Systems Architecture & Language Engineering  
- Designed a full compiler toolchain for a procedural language (Tiny)  
- AST implementation in Java 17 using record types, memoized reflection dispatch  
- Custom p-code virtual machine with typed instructions, stack frames, memory manager  
- Structured types (arrays, records, pointers), by-ref / by-val handling, exception control  
- VM memory modeled on two-level lock-free structures with FAT-style dynamic heap

> *“Designing a language from scratch was an act of storytelling — every type system, every control structure, every stack overflow handler was a choice about how logic should flow.”*

## 🛠 Technical Stack

I don't see technologies as labels — I see them as **ways to shape systems**:

- **Formal Methods**: Z3, SMT, logical modeling, invariants, assertions  
- **Hardware Design**: VHDL-AMS, Siemens PartQuest, MBSE, DO-254/DO-333  
- **Languages**: Python, Java, Haskell, Elixir, C++, DSL design  
- **Mathematics**: symbolic systems, algebra, graph theory, category theory  
- **Modeling**: connectomics, artificial neural systems, verification pipelines

## 🌍 What I believe

> *“Technology should be rigorous, but human.  
Not just correct, but interpretable.  
Not just fast, but meaningful.”*

I believe in designing systems that **mirror our cognitive structure without losing formal control**.  
That means bringing together aerospace-level discipline, philosophical questions, and human-centered design.

If you’re working at the intersection of formal methods, cognitive architecture, or safety-critical systems, I’d love to connect.
